Now you say this would be way cool if you could compile Python with
LibreSSL.  And, it would be more secure.  Then again, Python HTTPS was
never meant to be rigged out to be secure as it doesn't even check
certificates.  So there you go.  But here's the references for a
start.  It looks like getting started should be as easy as swapping
out the libraries and recompiling.

For another time, I must admit.  Yes, that will take time and all.
But then again, it may fix the build system problems that I went
through to build OpenSSL, so it is worth pursuing.
